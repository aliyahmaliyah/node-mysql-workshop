//Notice that for the previous exercise, Account #5 did not appear in the listing. Donâ€™t come back here until you have re-checked 
//the previous exercise and noticed for yourself that Account #5 is missing.

//The reason for this is because Account #5 does not have any AddressBook, so doing the JOIN left it out.
//Read and understand this article on SQL JOINs, more specifically about the LEFT JOIN.
//Based on your new understanding, create a similar program to Exercise #4.
